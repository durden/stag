#Stag

A dead-simple static site generator in Python.

##Goals

The main goal of stag is to be simple enough to use and digest with minimal
hand holding.  I (like lots of developers) am really attracted to the idea of
writing blogs/websites in just regular text.

Not all websites need a database.  My perosnal site is a great example.  I
simply want a place to post articles about the projects I'm working on and tell
the world a little about me.  In order to do this I want to take down any extra
walls that keep me from doing this effictively and often.

###Requirements

I prefer to write in vim and markdown.  So, I want to build this entire project
with only a single external dependency, markdown.  It might be nice later to
add support for a templating engine like jinja, etc.  However, I want to see if
I can get by with even less first.
